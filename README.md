### Hi, I'm Shubham 👋

Associate Staff Engineer with 6+ years building and maintaining full‑stack solutions using **.NET, C#, Azure, Angular, and SQL** in enterprise and analytics-heavy environments. I focus on scalable backend services, integrations, and multi‑tenant platforms that are reliable in production and easy to evolve over time.

Alongside my day job, I’m actively **learning and building with LLMs and agentic AI** — experimenting with multi‑agent orchestration, tool integrations, and RAG-style systems to automate research and workflow tasks. I'm especially interested in roles where strong backend and cloud engineering meet AI-driven capabilities.

**Current focus**

- Agentic AI systems and multi‑agent orchestration  
- Backend/platform work with .NET, Azure, and microservices  
- RAG applications and AI-assisted internal tools
